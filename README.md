This repository contains a detail analysis of wine quality prediction using supervised and unsupervised statistical learning methods on two datasets named “winequality-red.csv” and “winequality-white.csv”. The analysis begins by combining these two datasets, assigning appropriate labels and merging them into one dataset named “all_wines.xlsx”. The statistical learning models used in this analysis are Decision trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-means Clustering and Hierarchical clustering. To ensure the robustness and reliability of the models, I have implemented pruning of Decision trees by choosing an optimal cost parameter, parameter optimization for Random Forest, kernel discussion and parameter optimization for SVM. 5-Fold Cross-validation is employed to evaluate model performance in Decision trees and Random Forest. For unsupervised learning models, numerical data in the dataset were normalized/scaled to ensure fair contribution from all features, improve algorithm performance and enhance the interpretability of results.
